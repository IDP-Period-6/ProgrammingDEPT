#### Installing GitHub Desktop and Making a Local Clone
1.  Download GitHub desktop from [here](https://desktop.github.com/download/ "here").
2. When launching it, it installs immediately, do not click it more than once if the window takes a bit to pop up.
3. Click the button `Sign in to GitHub.com` and sign in with the account you gave William or me.
4. Let the application open `GitHubDesktop`. Ignore the page that pops up and just click "`Finish`".
5. If the repository was successfully shared with you, it should pop up!

6. Click the repository then click clone,  then clone again.
7. Don't touch anything here and click "`Open in Visual Studio Code`" (also `CTRL + Shift + A`). Trust the authors.
8. Open the explorer (`CTRL + Shift + E`) and expand .vscode.

#### Checking if GitHub works properly
1. Still in the explorer, expand the folder named "`.testnames`". Mine (Giorgio's) should already be there.
2. Create a new file using the little icon and name it `test<yourname>.txt`
	
 [![](https://i.imgur.com/8N0EiyD.png)](https://i.imgur.com/8N0EiyD.png)
 
3. Open the file, type your name in the box, then save by using the shortcut `CTRL + S`
4.  Open the Source Control Bar using `CTRL + Shift + G`  and expand the arrow near the commit button. Then, click `Commit & Push`

5. If there is a window that pops up about no stages to commit, click Always.
6. A window should pop up with green text. Type as follows in the white, save with `CTRL + S` and click the check

7. If everything went well, there should be nothing in the source control panel and commit should be greyed out. Good job! 
8. To see if the changes worked, open [this link](https://github.com/WillyWally34/ProgrammingDEPT/tree/main/.testnames "this link") and find your name. If it's there, then yay! Your VS Code is all set up.
